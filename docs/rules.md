# Platform Rules (v1.1)

By using this platform, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted these rules.

---

## 1. Platform Role

The platform provides a **technical service for collective acquisition of unique physical items**.

The platform:
- does NOT sell items
- does NOT own items
- does NOT organize lotteries or gambling
- does NOT guarantee item receipt for every participant

The platform acts solely as a **technical intermediary** providing escrow logic and transaction rules.

---

## 2. Participants

There are three roles on the platform:

- **Seller (Creator)** — the owner and sender of the item
- **Participant (User)** — a person who contributes funds
- **Platform** — a technical service provider

---

## 3. Item Listing (Seller Responsibilities)

The Seller lists a **ready-to-ship physical item** and defines:

- target sale amount (including shipping, packaging, insurance, customs, and all related costs)
- price of one participation token
- sale duration
- delivery regions

By listing an item, the Seller confirms that:
- the item belongs to them
- the item is ready for shipment
- the item does not violate applicable laws

---

## 4. Participation and Payment

- Users participate by purchasing **platform participation tokens**
- Payments are accepted **only in cryptocurrency**
- After purchasing tokens:
  - funds are **locked**
  - cancellation is **not possible**
  - refunds are **not possible**, except as described below

Participation tokens represent **units of participation**, not ownership or investment.

### 5.1 Target Amount NOT Reached

If the target amount is not reached before the end of the sale period:

- all participants receive a **refund in platform tokens**
